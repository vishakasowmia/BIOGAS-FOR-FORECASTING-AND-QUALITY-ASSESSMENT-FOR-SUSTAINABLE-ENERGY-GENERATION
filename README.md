# BIOGAS FOR FORECASTING AND QUALITY ASSESSMENT FOR SUSTAINABLE ENERGY GENERATION


The challenge is to develop a reliable predictive model for biogas production that incorporates threshold-based quality assessment and income estimation, enabling efficient and sustainable electricity generation while addressing the complexities associated with variable feedstock, environmental factors, and economic viability.



## Objective
* Develop a Predictive Model: Create a machine learning model capable of forecasting biogas production, which can be used to predict the volume of biogas generated over time.

* Threshold Determination: Establish a threshold value for biogas quality, allowing for the assessment of its suitability for electricity generation. If the threshold is not met, calculate the additional organic waste required to meet it.

* Income Estimation: Estimate the monthly income generated from the biogas production process, considering factors such as electricity sales, maintenance costs, and feedstock expenses.

* Forecasting: Utilize the predictive model to forecast future biogas production trends, providing insights into long-term planning for sustainable energy generation.

* Dashboard : Visualize the data.

## Dataset
For this project, we used our University dataset.

* Output of Electricity prediction
Here it will suggest to us how much electricity is needed to generate a 40-watt bulb from the given wet-waste and biogas if it is not sufficient then it suggest us how much more wet-waste and biogas is required.
